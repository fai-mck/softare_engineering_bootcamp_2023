capstone_1_.py project
This program is a task manager which enables the user to add task, generate reports and display statistics related to those tasks.

**INSTALLATION**
This program needs to be downloaded along with the two text files 'tasks.txt' and 'user.txt'.

**USAGE**
Upon running the program, it will ask you to login. You will find the login details and password of the admin in the 'user.txt' file. This will allow you to access
the full functionality of the program. From here, you can add another user, add tasks, view tasks, generate reports and display statistics.

**CREDITS**
HyperionDev - The basics of the code were supplied by HyperionDev. 
Fairuz Mc Kenzie - I refactored the code through the principle of abstraction: I created the functions and added the functionality to those functions as well as wrote the code for the
'generate reports' and 'display statistics' options. I added the option to 'add another task' after the user has already added a task.
